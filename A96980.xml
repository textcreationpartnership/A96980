            <title>A chronological account of the age of the world at the birth of every one of the Ancient Fathers, from Adam to the Flood of Noah, the kings of Judah, the captivity of Babilon, and the end thereof, till the death of the Messiah to which are added several remarks concerning the end of the first six thousand years of this world's-age, and what may be expected for a thousand years thence next following, and some thoughts concerning the end of the world. As also a brief exposition of the thirteenth of the Revelations: much differing from all that ever was before it. Wherein is sett forth; first, who the two beasts therein mentioned are. Secondly, when they began. Thirdly, how long they are to continue. Fourthly, when their end shall be. Wherein that [my]stical number of 666, is fully explained.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN <hi>Exodus</hi> 38. 26 and 29 it is there ſaid, that 603550 Men offered every Man a <hi>Bekah</hi> or an half <hi>Shekle;</hi> one half thereof is 301775 whole <hi>Shekles,</hi> according to the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle</hi> of the Sanctuary, which by computation, is Two Shillings and Six-pence, or Half a Crown <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One half of that Sum is 150887 whole Crowns, and one Half Crown. Half of the ſaid Crowns make 75443 and an half, theſe are Angels or half Pounds, Half of the ſaid Angels makes 37721 Pounds, Ten Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. The Total of this Great Offering amounts (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reckoned after our Engliſh Pounds) to the Sum of 37721 Pounds 17 Shilllings and 6 Pence.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:152782:10"/>
            <p>Now to know how many of theſe make a Talent. the 301775 being <hi>Shekles</hi> or half Crowns, and being Divided by 3000, the <hi>Quotient</hi> will be 100, (that is an Hundred Talents) and 1775 <hi>Shekles</hi> remaining, ſo that this remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is but part of a Talent, and ſo would 2999 be but part becauſe it wanted one of 3000 which is a Talent, So that 3000 <hi>Shekles of the Sanctuary,</hi> which is a Talent, is in Value of Engliſh Money 375 Pound. But if we Reckon 3000 of the common <hi>Shekles,</hi> it comes but to one half of the <hi>Shekle of the Sanctuary,</hi> which is but 187 Pound ten Shillings.</p>
